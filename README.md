This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to the use of `innerHTML` with HTML snippets containing nested `<script>` tags.  The primary issue arises when a variable containing HTML, including a `<script>` tag, is used to set the `innerHTML` of an element.  This can lead to unexpected execution contexts and security vulnerabilities if the injected HTML is not carefully sanitized. The solution shows how to safely inject HTML.
